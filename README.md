# Allied Bombings conducted over Germany during WWII

This project here was my first foray into doing anything data visualisation related and that roughness is apparent in the end result but I still had a fair amount of fun doing this. The project itself formed the capstone work of my Computational and Simulation Science major which introduced me to the field of Data Science as a whole.

# Main Goal of the Project
This project aimed to model the bombings conducted over Germany and to see if there was any correlation between the bombing times/locations and that of the GDP/Military production. Where the production was measured in terms of Rifles and Different vehicle types (These types being Tanks and Bomber/Fighter Planes)

# Datasets Used
**Primary Data Source**
  Theater History of Operations (THOR) 
  
**Secondary Data Sources**
  1. Production Data of Rifles/Differing Vehicles Types
  1. GDP of the German Reich
  
 # Coding Language
 1.MATLAB was the primary language used for visualition
 1. Excel was used to manipulate the datasets to be in a usable format for MATLAB.
